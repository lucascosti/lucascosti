* ❤️ Organ donation! After almost 10 years of living with [a progressive liver disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sclerosing_cholangitis), I was incredibly grateful to [receive a liver transplant in 2019](https://lucascosti.com/blog/2019/07/transplant-life-changing-event/). Needless to say, I am a passionate advocate for organ donation!
