### 👋 G'day! 

I'm Lucas! I'm from Brisbane, Australia and I'm a technical writer on the GitHub docs team. 📝

#### Me on GitHub

* 🏢 You can find the work my team does in the open source [GitHub Docs](https://github.com/github/docs) repo. 
* 💻 I keep track of my computer's config in my [mac-config](https://github.com/lucascosti/mac-config) repo.

* ❤️ Organ donation! After almost 10 years of living with [a progressive liver disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_sclerosing_cholangitis), I was incredibly grateful to [receive a liver transplant in 2019](https://lucascosti.com/blog/2019/07/transplant-life-changing-event/). Needless to say, I am a passionate advocate for organ donation!
